# The Manifesto

## The OFC Manifesto – A Living Promise

This manifesto is not a set of rules.  
It is not a contract.  
It is not dogma.

It is a **field of words** – a remembrance, an invitation, a promise.

Written in the circle, born at the fire, carried by those who are willing to **live together, instead of fighting alone.**

### Manifesto of Conscious Community

#### 1. We build a field that supports

Community is not a romantic dream.  
It is work, dedication, and daily compassion.

That’s why we start with a core.  
With people who are willing to face themselves, to reflect each other, to hold each other.

Only when the field is strong enough, we open it.

#### 2. Not everyone may join immediately

We believe in inclusion – but not in self-destruction in the name of tolerance.

We do not accept people who only want to consume or escape.  
We only invite those who are willing to contribute, to transform, and to engage.

#### 3. We integrate, not rescue

We do not help.  
We accompany.  
We demand co-responsibility.

Wounded souls are welcome – if they hear the call, not to ask for help, but to step into the circle.

#### 4. We speak, we listen, we decide together

We use the circle.  
The talking stick.  
Silent listening.  
Consensus.

No boss. No guru. No alpha.  
Just people who show themselves honestly.  
And act together.
