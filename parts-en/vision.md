# The Vision of OFC

## The Birth at the Fire

It was one of those quiet nights.  
A small circle.  
A brother from Estonia, a fire shaman.  
A conversation beyond time.

We spoke about what was.  
About what is missing.  
About what still lives on.

And there – in the glow of the embers, without agenda – something emerged.  
Not from theory. Not from strategy.  
But from a real, simple, human need:

🔥 **OFC – Open Free Communities** 🔥

A space for people who are tired of ownership, control, hierarchy.  
But also tired of chaos, fog, and “everyone just doing their own thing.”

A new balance.  
A living organism.  
A home for those who want to help carry the field.

## OFC: Open Free Communities and “of course”

The name came playfully, almost like a joke.  
“Can I stay the night?”  
"**ofc**"  
“Can I stay the week?”  
"**ofc**"  
“Can I stay the whole year?”  
"**ofc, if you work together with us.**"

**OFC is invitation.**  
OFC is answer.  
OFC is open – but not aimless.

It’s not about accepting everyone.  
It’s about **holding the space**.  
And then sensing who can **breathe with us**.  

## A Space Where No One Owns Anything – and Everything Is Possible

OFC is not a project.  
OFC is a field.

No one owns the land.  
Because ownership divides.  
But the land is **guarded**.  
By a foundation.  
Carried by people, not controlled by individuals.

It’s not about property here.  
It’s about relationship.  
To earth. To water. To fire. To community.

When you arrive, you won’t be asked:  
“What did you bring?”  
But rather:  
> **“How are you here?”**

And if you stay, it’s not because you must – but because you **want to contribute**.

## How We Welcome People – and Why Not All at Once

We are not elitist.  
But we are not arbitrary either.

We believe in unconditional love – but not in unconditional access.  
Because a field that everyone wants to carry at once needs **stability**.

That’s why OFC starts small.  
With a circle.  
With people who know what it means to listen, to hold, to heal.

Only when the field is ready do we invite new people.

And then we don’t say:  
“You’re allowed in.”  
But rather:  
> **“Welcome – if you walk with us.”**

Not everyone who drops out wants to rise up.  
But everyone who sets out on the path deserves a real place.  

If they are ready to **become part – not just a guest.**
