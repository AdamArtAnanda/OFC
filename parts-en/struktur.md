# The Structure That Supports

## The Swiss Foundation as Guardian of the Land

True freedom needs a strong foundation.  
Not made of concrete – but of responsibility.

We have decided that the land on which OFC communities arise **must not belong to a single individual.**

Because:  
- Ownership creates power.  
- Power creates fear.  
- And fear destroys the trust we need.

Instead, we are founding a **foundation based in Switzerland.**  
A legal framework that protects the land – from speculation, from expropriation, from private control.  
A construct that says:  
> **“This land belongs to itself.”**

The foundation is the guardian – not the ruler.  
And it serves only one purpose:  
**to preserve the space so that life can grow there.**

## Why Land Should Not Be Owned, but Protected

The Earth belongs to no one.  
And precisely because of that, we are responsible for her.

When we “buy” land, we do so only to remove it from the reach of the market.  
To protect it – not to own it.

We don’t want owners.  
We want **guardians.**

People who care.  
Not because they have to – but because they know:  
**This piece of Earth is a living being.**

That’s why the foundation is only the legal framework.  
The true contract is a **field contract.**  
Between person and place.  
Between soul and purpose.

## Field Care Instead of Rules

We don’t make laws.  
We don’t write regulations.  
We work with something else:  
**Field care.**

That means:  
- We pay attention to vibration, not paragraphs.  
- We sense disharmony – and step into the circle.  
- We listen before we react.  
- We act before things escalate.

A living space needs no rigid rules  
when people are **present, aware, and honest.**

It’s not always easy.  
But it is real.

## Integration Instead of Rescue

OFC is not a place for spiritual tourism.  
Nor a safe space for those avoiding life.

But:  
We believe in the power of healing.  
And we believe  
that every person deserves the chance to **arrive anew.**

But for that, a clear YES is needed.

Not to us – but to one’s own transformation.

That’s why we say:  
> **“Yes, you may be here – if you are willing to walk with us.”**

We do not rescue anyone.  
But we **walk together** –  
through light and shadow.

## Consensus, Circles & Clarity

We decide in the circle.  
With the talking stick. With presence. With patience.

No majority vote. No boss. No forcing through.  
Instead:  
**Listening, digesting, repeating, clarifying.**

Consensus doesn’t mean everyone is cheering.  
Consensus means:  
> **“I can go along – even if it’s not my favorite.”**

This is how true community emerges.  
Not through sameness – but through **shared alignment.**

## ✨ BONUS: How a Foundation Can Be Managed Through a DAO

We combine the best of two worlds:

🛡️ The Foundation – stable, legally recognized, protective.  
🌐 The DAO – transparent, decentralized, democratic.

Instead of building internal power structures, we use a **DAO-based decision system** that relies on blockchain technology.

That means:  
- All members have a voice.  
- Decisions are documented decentrally.  
- Nothing is decided “at the top,” everything emerges **in the circle of participants.**

The DAO is **not an end in itself**, but a tool to hold the field – clearly, transparently, comprehensibly.

**High Tech for High Spirit.**

Because we live in a world in which we are allowed to use tools – as long as they serve freedom.
