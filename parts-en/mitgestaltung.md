# Call to Co-Creation – Your Place in the Circle

This book is not an ending.  
It is a beginning.

The idea is alive.  
The vision is growing.  
And now it needs hands, hearts, voices, and strength.

We are starting with the first **Open Free Community**.  
And for that, we need:

## 💰 Financial Support

To secure the first piece of land permanently, we are founding a **non-profit foundation in Switzerland.**  
For this, we need around **50,000 CHF in starting capital**.

This money does not go into private ownership, but into the guardianship of the Earth.  
It is **a contribution to protecting the future.**

## 🛠️ Pioneers & Earth Keepers

We are looking for people who don’t just talk, but **want to take action**:

- 🛖 A tiny house for an **Earth Keeper** living on site  
- 🌱 They will plant the first garden – enough food for 3 families  
- 🌻 When 2 families join, they’ll grow food for 9 more  
- ♻️ Compost toilets, an open kitchen, water pipes  
- 🎪 A 10-meter dome for **talking circles, workshops & celebrations**  
- 🚿 An outdoor shower – with a view of the stars

What we need is **not much** – but **the right things**.

## 🧭 Are You Called?

- Do you want to bless a piece of Earth with your energy?  
- Do you want to give money – into a future that grows?  
- Do you want to help build – with hands, heart, and devotion?  
- Or simply become part – of a living, free field?

Then don’t say: *“Someday…”*  
But rather:  
> **“ofc – I’m in.”**
