# Remembrance

## Hearts of the Earth – The Spiritual Foundation

Before an idea is born, before a structure is formed – there is something deeper: A remembrance.  

Not of something we learned, but of something we **could never forget.**

A quiet voice within us, that says:  
> *This is how life is meant to be.*  

In the stillness of the morning,  
in the crackling of the fire,  
in the eyes of a child,  
in the song of a bird.  
That’s where we feel it.

This remembrance is not a concept.  
It is a field.  
And this very field is described by the **Manifesto of the Hearts of the Earth Foundation**.

A manifesto not written with the head, but flowed from the heart.  
A prayer in words.  
A remembrance of what we already are.

## We Come From the Fire

I remember many nights, when I sat in a circle with people.  
No electricity. No internet. No plan.  
Just wood, flame, song, silence.

The fire brings us back.  
Not back to the past, but **back to the now.**

At the fire there is no “I’m right.”  
At the fire there are no masks.  
Only presence.  
Only inhale. Exhale.  
Sharing a piece of bread.  
Singing a song.  
A gaze that does not compare, but recognizes.

We come from the fire.  
And that’s where we return.

## When the Circle Fell Silent – Rainbow in Times of Fear

And then came the rupture.  
Not through violence. Not through politics.  
But through something invisible: **Fear.**

The Rainbow Gatherings were canceled.  
The circles fell silent.  
People who once shouted “Welcome,” closed their hearts and said: “Not now. Too dangerous.”

Later there were circles again – but they were laced with mistrust, with prohibitions, with police, with separation.

Even among those who called themselves “free,” they began to exclude others.  
Because they didn’t fit into the new worldview.  
Because they asked critical questions.  
Because they simply wanted **to be.**

I myself was excluded – not out of anger, not out of rebellion, but because I said:  
> “Let us remember. With us, everyone may join.”

## The Lesson from Tamera

Tamera.  
A place that burned in me as a living vision for a long time.  
A place of healing, of community, of truth.

But when I was there – in the middle of the pandemic – there was also **silence.**  
No open space. No guests. No shared field.

I do not judge.  
Because I know how hard it is to hold space when fear comes in waves.  
But I understood:  
**Even the most beautiful visions need roots to withstand storms.**

It is not enough to be a place.  
You have to be a **field**, a shared consciousness that doesn’t falter when the outside world gets loud.

The remembrance lives on.  
Not in a utopia.  
But in every moment in which we choose:  
🔥 To sit in a circle.  
🔥 To listen to each other.  
🔥 To own nothing – and yet share everything.

This is the ground on which **OFC – Open Free Communities** may grow.
