# Life in the Circle

## Welcome. Stay. Contribute.

An OFC is not a hotel.  
Not a camp.  
Not a project.

It is a **home** that emerges when people are **willing to carry together.**

That’s why the most important question is not: “How long can I stay?”  
But rather:  
> **“How can I contribute?”**

Whether you sing, cook, build, listen, or laugh – every gift counts.  
What matters is your **YES to the field.**

Those who stay are part of it.  
Those who leave are blessed.  
No one must. No one may simply take.  
We live in a cycle – not in consumption.

## Children, Animals, Plants – how we live together

An OFC is more than people.  
It is a living ecosystem.

🌱 Children run freely across the meadow – not raised, but **accompanied**.  
Not lectured, but **seen**.

🐾 Animals are friends, not function.  
Not livestock, not objects.  
They belong to the field like you and me.

🌻 Plants are our food, our medicine, our teachers.  
We grow, we trade, we share.  
No supermarket, but a garden of life.

We live with what is here.  
We create no waste.  
We celebrate abundance – even when it looks simple.

## Rituals & Rhythms – how the field stays stable

Community does not arise through intention, but through **rhythm.**

We begin the day in the circle.  
Sometimes in silence. Sometimes singing. Sometimes with tears.  
But always **honestly**.

We listen.  
We ask.  
We give space.

There is no obligation – but an invitation to be part of the heartbeat.

🔥 In the evenings, someone often sits by the fire.  
We don’t always speak.  
Sometimes it’s just the crackling that connects us.

🌕 New moon. Full moon. Transitions.  
We celebrate when life calls.  
Not out of tradition, but out of presence.

## No Dogma. Just Heart.

We have no gurus.  
We follow no book.  
We don’t believe anyone is “further along.”

We believe in the heart.  
In what heals when we listen.  
In what works when we are honest.

You may be you.  
But you will show yourself.  
Because an OFC only lives  
when we are **truly present.**

We are not perfect.  
But we are willing to meet each other.  
Truly.  
In the circle.

And that’s enough.  
For everything.
