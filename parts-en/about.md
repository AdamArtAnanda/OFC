# About Us – The Rainbow Family

We are **not an organization.**  
We have **no structure.**  
We have **no manifesto – only the circle.**

The **Rainbow Family** is a worldwide network of people who feel free, open, spiritual, connected to nature, and communal.

Since the 1970s, we have gathered in meadows and forests, sharing food, music, stories, and silence.  
We live for a time **without money, without consumption, in primal trust**.

There is no registration, no tickets, no dogma.  
Only the phrase:  
> **“We love you.”**

From this energy, **OFC** was born.  
Not as a replacement for Rainbow – but as a **tangible expression** of this frequency.  
A place where the vision may take root – lasting, stable, with an open heart.

## 🌈 Invitation

If you feel that you are **part of it**, then you already are.

If you are still hesitant – be welcome to listen.

And if you are ready – come into the circle.

**We need you.**  
**Not as a savior – but as a co-dreamer. Co-carrier. Co-creator.**

🔥 We do not build against the old.  
🔥 We build **for the new.**

**OFC – of course.**
